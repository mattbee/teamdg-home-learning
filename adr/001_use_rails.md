# Use Ruby on Rails

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I needed to choose a way to build this site. Choices could be anything, static site generator, plain old HTML, Django, or even WordPress.

We're currently in coronavirus lockdown and I wanted to do something cool for all the kids in my sons class, and build a site with just reception level activities, making it easy for the parents to find something to do.

## Decision

I am choosing Rails.

## Consequences

This might be overkill for what the website will do, but it means I can keep my hand in on Rails, despite working more with Python lately. By using Rails I can do almost anything, and will know how to do it and therefore iterate quickly as things are needed.

Lockdown might last a few months, or at least the home schooling might, so want to support people as best I can, and I know Rails and can automate things easiest in Rails, like preloading the content and letting suggestions change everyday, from a DB full of suggestions.
