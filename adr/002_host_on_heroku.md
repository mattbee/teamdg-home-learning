# Host on Heroku

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The site needs somewhere to live.

## Decision

I am choosing Heroku.

## Consequences

Heroku is paid, but I know it well and it has free SSL certificates, required to link to Google hangouts links.

It's easy to deploy to and to hook into CircleCI for CI/CD.

It might be harder to build our own server should that be a thing I decide to learn from this, but it will be a good learning exercise.
